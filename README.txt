Description:
Source code enabling replication of experiments in the paper by
M. Domino, M. Romaszewski,  T. Jasinski,  M. Masko
`Comparison of surface thermal patterns of horses and donkeys in IRT images'
preprint: http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09302

Implementation:
Experiments were implemented in Python 3.6.9 using libraries:
numpy 1.16.4,scipy 1.3.1, scikit-learn 0.22.1, matplotlib 3.2.2

The dataset associated with that source code: 
https://zenodo.org/deposit/4085075

Usage:
Ensure the dataset patch in thermal_utils.py is correct
Each thermal_fig.* file is linked to a figure from the paper and presents the related results
