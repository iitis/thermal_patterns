## Description:

Source code enabling replication of experiments in the paper:
Domino, M.; Romaszewski, M.; Jasiński, T.; Maśko, M. 
Comparison of the Surface Thermal Patterns of Horses and Donkeys in Infrared Thermography Images. 
Animals 2020, 10, 2201. 
https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10122201


## Implementation:

Experiments were implemented in Python 3.6.9 using libraries:
NumPy 1.16.4, SciPy 1.3.1, scikit-learn 0.22.1, Matplotlib 3.2.2, seaborn 0.11.0.

## The dataset associated with that source code:

## Usage:

Ensure the dataset patch in thermal_utils.py is correct
Each thermal_fig.* file is linked to a figure from the paper and presents the related results
