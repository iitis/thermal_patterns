## Description:

Source code enabling replication of experiments in the paper by
M. Domino, M. Romaszewski,  T. Jasiński,  M. Maśko
`Comparison of surface thermal patterns of horses and donkeys in IRT images'
preprint: http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09302

## Implementation:

Experiments were implemented in Python 3.6.9 using libraries:
NumPy 1.16.4, SciPy 1.3.1, scikit-learn 0.22.1, Matplotlib 3.2.2, seaborn 0.11.0.

## The dataset associated with that source code:

## Usage:

Ensure the dataset patch in thermal_utils.py is correct
Each thermal_fig.* file is linked to a figure from the paper and presents the related results
